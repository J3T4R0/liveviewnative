# generate_tutorial_repo
This tool parses the DocC `.tutorial` files in the package and uses them to automatically generate [a repo](https://github.com/liveviewnative/ios-tutorial) showing the state of the projects after each step in the tutorial. It also verifies that the projects are compile-able after each step.
